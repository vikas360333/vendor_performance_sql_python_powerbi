## Summary
“This analysis helped the business identify profitable vendors, optimize inventory, improve purchase strategies, and make data-driven procurement decisions — ultimately reducing costs and improving profit margins.”

## Problem Statement
Management didn’t know which vendors were truly profitable versus those driving losses
Large amounts of capital were tied up in slow-moving or unsold inventory, hurting cash flow.
The company lacked clarity on how bulk purchasing affected pricing and margins.
Some brands had low sales volume but high profit margins, and management didn’t know whether to promote or discontinue them.
Business decisions were previously based on intuition rather than facts.

## Dataset
I have used four csv file sales, purchase, purchase_price, vendor_invoice.

## Tools
Python-  libraries: pandas, numpy, sqlite3 / SQLAlchemy, os / logging / time  
Database- SQLite, SQL  
Data Visualization- Matplotlib and Seaborn  
statistical analysis- SciPy (scipy.stats)  
Analytical Tools- Power BI  

## Key Insights
1. Top 10 vendors accounted for the majority of total purchases and sales revenue — confirming vendor concentration.
2. Low-performing vendors showed low stock turnover (<1), meaning excess inventory and slow-moving products.
3. Unsold inventory value revealed a large portion of capital locked in non-performing stock — an area for cost recovery.
4. High-margin but low-sales brands were identified — these are potential opportunities for marketing or discount campaigns to improve revenue.
5. Bulk purchase advantage observed — vendors offering larger quantities had lower unit purchase costs.
6. Statistical test results (t-test) showed a significant difference in profit margins between top-performing and low-performing vendors.

## Conclusion
1. The analysis helped prioritize profitable and efficient vendors while flagging those with low sales or high inventory risk.
2. Provided actionable insights to improve purchasing decisions, reduce holding costs, and enhance overall profitability.
3.Demonstrated how data-driven vendor management can directly impact business performance and supply chain efficiency.
